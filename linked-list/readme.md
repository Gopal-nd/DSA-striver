# linked list 

## what is linked list
it store data in continouse location
the size can be increased in dynamic way

they will store in the head memory

each elment + next element addres

starting point is called HEAD
elemets
end is called TAIL ant it will point to null


## where is used 

in stacks , and que 

reallife browser

## structs and classes

`int n =2`
`int* y = &x`
`cout << y`

struct
`struct node{
int data;
node* next;
node(data1,next1){
data = data1;
next = next1;
}
}`

## memory

it store data and location of next address

A linked list is a linear data structure where each element (node) contains a value and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence. It allows efficient insertions and deletions at both ends but requires traversal to access elements at arbitrary positions.
